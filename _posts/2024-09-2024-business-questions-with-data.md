### Urgency to Apply my Knowledge

In Fall of 2023, I had reached the point where I knew I needed to start looking for internships since I was graduating the following year. I was intimidated by the the job market because it seemed like there was a lack of internship positions available for the amount of people applying. I used all career platforms such as LinkedIn, Handshake, and Indeed but all I got were a couple of first interviews and dozens of rejection emails. While having an internship puts you ahead of the job hunting game, my main reason to get one is to start applying my skills I've learned with real life data. I was feeling a sense of urgency because the skills that I had learned just the previous semester were already fleeing my memory. I knew I needed to find an opportunity where I could apply my knowledge as soon as possible.  

### Opportunity Arises at BYU Broadcasting

By April 2024, I had heard of an opportunity to work at BYU Broadcasting from my statistical modeling class. After 2 rounds of interviews, I was so excited to hear that they wanted to offer me a position for a hybrid position as a data analyst/data engineer on their Business Intelligence Team (a.k.a BIT)! I was able to start the following month and started training on using tools such as DOMO (a cloud based data management platform) and AWS (Amazon Web Services--a comprehensive cloud computing platfrom created by Amazon). I knew I had a lot to learn but I felt that my courses that I had recently taken gave me a good foundation to start on.


### Meeting The Lisa Show Team

The Lisa Show is a BYU Radio podcast hosted by Lisa Valentine Clark that covers a wide variety of topics from parenting to personal growth. One of my responsibilities is to help The Lisa Show answer questions about their show and share any useful insights I see from their data. Since I was new, the lead data analyst and data scientist scheduled an introductory meeting for me to meet with The Lisa Show production team. From that introductory meeting, I was able to take notes and discuss what knowledge their team wanted to know to help their podcast audience grow. Meeting with The Lisa Show was insightful because I was able to hear what they wanted to know for their show. Although I had taken thorough notes from the meeting, I didn't anticipate what would be my biggest struggle would be: taking their questions and modeling it into a data problem.


### Translating the Classroom to the Business World

I took my notes, cleaned them up a bit, and narrowed down their ideas into these questions:

##### The Lisa Show Questions
1. Does the audience enjoy the series/season layout for episodes?
    - They are changing the layout of their podcast in July--what differences will we see with listeners?
2. Which series are more popular than others? Why?
3. Is there a connection between popular posts/reels and increased listeners?

I remember feeling proud that I could take what they expressed and model it into these key questions. The Lisa Show team has a different background and purpose than I do. They trust me to take their questions and somehow apply it with the skills I've learned at BYU. At the end of the meeting, Ww scheduled a follow-up meeting with eachother for the end of the summer. Since they were planning on releasing a new series with a different format in July, they wanted to have enough time to pass by to see if there was any change with listeners.

With my team, we divided and conquer on projects which means puts everyone on a different route. Although I have more experienced co-workers and leaders to help me, we are all working on a our own projects which means I am in charge of how I hash out these projects.
