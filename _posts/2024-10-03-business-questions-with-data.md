<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this post, I share my experience transitioning from student to data analyst, tackling real-world problems at BYU Broadcasting. From navigating a competitive internship search to working with The Lisa Show team, I discuss how I applied classroom knowledge to solve business challenges using data. Along the way, I learned the importance of mapping out a clear process to tackle complex projects, and I share insights into the data science framework that helped me succeed..</p>


### Urgency to Apply my Knowledge

In Fall 2023, I knew it was time to look for internships before graduating the following year. The job market seemed tough, with too many applicants and too few positions. I applied on platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, and Indeed, but mostly got rejection emails, which added to my anxiety. Beyond the resume boost, I needed an internship to apply the skills I had learned with real-life data before they faded from my memory. 

### Opportunity Arises at BYU Broadcasting

By April 2024, I heard about an opportunity at BYU Broadcasting through my statistical modeling class. After two rounds of interviews, I was thrilled to receive an offer for a hybrid data analyst/data engineer position on the Business Intelligence Team (BIT). I started in May and began learning tools like DOMO and AWS. Thankfully, my recent coursework gave me a solid foundation to build on.

### Meeting The Lisa Show Team

One of my responsibilities is working with The Lisa Show, a BYU Radio podcast hosted by Lisa Valentine Clark. My job is to help them answer questions about their audience and extract insights from their data. During my first meeting with the production team, I took notes on what they wanted to learn to grow their audience. Translating their goals into data problems was my first real challenge.

### Translating the Classroom to the Business World

From the meeting, I distilled their questions into three key areas:

1. Does the audience enjoy the series/season layout for episodes?
2. Which series are more popular and why?
3. Is there a connection between popular posts/reels and increased listeners?

I felt proud to model their questions into these points, but this was where my academic experience fell short. In class, every project was clearly laid out by professors. Here, I had to map out the problem and manage the project myself, which was unfamiliar territory.

#### Learning the Processs
Fortunately, my co-workers helped guide me through a structured process to tackle the problem. Here’s the general data science framework I now follow:

1. Identify the problem: Narrow down the core questions.
2. Collect data: Identify existing datasets or gather new data.
3. Clean and wrangle the data: Handle missing values, standardize formats.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use basic visualizations to spot patterns.
5. Modeling: Apply machine learning methods like supervised, unsupervised, or time series analysis.
6. Interpret and deploy: Choose the best models, present findings clearly.

### Now What?
This process keeps me focused and on track, though I’ve learned it’s not always linear. Jumping between steps—like going back to clean data while modeling—is common, and that’s okay. I’m still working through step 5 for The Lisa Show, but having this process outlined has helped me manage my time and expectations. If you're taking on a project, I recommend using this structure to stay organized. I invite you to write down these key points and apply it to your next personal or buisness project.
