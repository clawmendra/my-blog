### Love for Pets

Throughout my childhood, I was surrounded with all sorts of pets. I pretty much had any type of pet that you could domesticate: cats, dogs, hamsters, birds, fish, and even hermit crabs. My pets were a source of love and companionship that I had that helped me with the trials that my family faced. When I got married and moved out of my home to study at BYU-Idaho University, I was diagnoised with depression and anxiety. Along with the support of counseling and medication, I wanted to adopt an emotional support animal to help me as well. I looked online to see where I could adopt a cat near me and came across the website Petfinder.

### What is Petfinder?

[Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) is one of the largest online, searchable databases used to promote pets in your area that are available for adoption. U.S. Shelters and adoption organizations can use this technology to maintain their own pet database and create profiles for their pets. Petfinder also allows those looking to adopt to create a profile to share information on what type of pet they are looking for to match with compatible pets.
